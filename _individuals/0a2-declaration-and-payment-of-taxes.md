# Declaration and Payment of Taxes

## What to declare?

Under Singapore’s laws, arriving travellers are required to declare and pay the duty and Goods and Services Tax (GST) to bring in dutiable and taxable goods exceeding their  [duty-free concession and GST relief](https://singapore-customs-staging.netlify.com/individuals/0a1-duty-free-concession-and-gst-relief). This is applicable whether the goods were purchased overseas or in Singapore.

***

### Dutiable Goods and GST Taxable Goods
There are four categories of dutiable goods in Singapore:

-   **Intoxicating liquors**, including spirits, wine, beer, ale, stout and porter
    -   Beverages and liquors consumed for health reasons and used for cooking are dutiable if the alcoholic strength by volume exceeds 0.5% (eg shandy, bottled alcoholic cocktail drinks, D.O.M., Yomeishu, samsoo and rice wine)
-   **Tobacco products**, including cigarettes and cigars
-   **Motor vehicles**, including motorised bicycles
-   **Motor fuel**, including motor spirits, diesel products and compressed natural gas (CNG)

All goods imported into Singapore are subject to GST.

***

### Payment of Taxes
Payment of Duties and GST can be made via the following payment modes:

-   All major credit cards (MasterCard, Visa and American Express), mobile wallets, NETS and Cashcard at the Singapore Customs Tax Payment Office
-   Visa or Master credit cards on the  [Customs@SG Mobile App and Web Application](https://singapore-customs-staging.netlify.com/eservices/customs-sg-mobile-and-web-application/)

## How to declare?

Major traveller entry checkpoints in Singapore operate the Red and Green Channels system. The Red and Green Channel signs are above the examination counters in the arrival hall after immigration clearance. At certain checkpoints, forward security checks are conducted  before immigration clearance. If you are carrying any dutiable, taxable, controlled or prohibited goods, please declare them to the checking officer at the Red Channel or at the Customs Examination Area before immigration clearance.

Proceed to the Green Channel if you are not carrying any declarable goods stated above. ICA officers will conduct selective checks at the Green Channel.

If in doubt, always ask the checking officers at the Red Channel/Customs Examination Area or approach the Singapore Customs Tax Payment Office.

It is the responsibility of travellers to make an accurate and complete declaration of all goods exceeding their duty-free concession and GST relief in their possession, including goods carried for or on behalf of other persons.

Those who fail to do so can be fined and prosecuted in court. More information on customs offences is available [here.](https://singapore-customs-staging.netlify.com/individuals/0c-offences)
