## For Authorised Agents

Authorised agents have a distributorship agreement signed with the owner of a brand of motor vehicle, which allows them to import and distribute that brand of motor vehicles in certain territories.

If you are a new authorised agent or an existing agent with queries on the import processes and procedures, you may contact us via [Customs_TTSB@customs.gov.sg](mailto:Customs_TTSB@customs.gov.sg) or call 6355 2104/2106/2118.

Existing agents are required to submit Agent's Application for Product Code (SC-A-004) for new models or should there be changes to price, specifications, model code, model year, invoicing currency, incoterm, and assigned supplier of the vehicles they carry.

Please complete this  [form](https://form.gov.sg/5e7db3d7b62f4d0011b83dc5)  and submit it with the supporting documents listed in Section D.
