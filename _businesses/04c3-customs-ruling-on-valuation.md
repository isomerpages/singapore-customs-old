# Customs Ruling on Valuation

The customs value is determined based on valuation principles from the  [Customs (Valuation) Regulations](https://www.customs.gov.sg/-/media/cus/files/business/valuation-duties-taxes-and-fees/customsvaluationregulations2.pdf?la=en&hash=241DCA4960361347C269CB0FDA3AE54EC49C98C5).

You may apply for a Customs ruling on valuation before importing your goods. Do refer to the valuation principles when preparing your application.

Singapore Customs will evaluate and determine the customs valuation treatment of the arrangement. A Customs ruling on valuation will be issued, indicating the applicant's/company's name and address, treatment on customs valuation and conditions to maintain the validity of treatment.
