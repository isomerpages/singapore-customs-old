-   Commercial invoice
-   Bill of lading
-   Freight and insurance invoices
-   Bills/receipts relating to incidental charges incurred during shipment
-   Full manufacturer’s specification card (a listing of standard and optional equipment on the vehicle and unique for every vehicle)
-   Completion Inspection Certificate (CIC) Paper
-   Registration/De-registration documents from the country of exportation
-   Manufacturer’s letter confirming date of vehicle’s manufacture
-   Payment documents for the purchase (for example, telegraphic transfer slip)
-   Clear photos of the odometer (showing mileage), interior, exterior and engine/chassis number (for used vehicles)

## For Authorised Agents
Authorised agents have a distributorship agreement signed with the owner of a brand of motor vehicle, which allows them to import and distribute that brand of motor vehicles in certain territories.

If you are a new authorised agent or an existing agent with queries on the import processes and procedures, you may contact us via [Customs_TTSB@customs.gov.sg](mailto:Customs_TTSB@customs.gov.sg) or call 6355 2104/2106/2118.

Existing agents are required to submit Agent's Application for Product Code (SC-A-004) for new models or should there be changes to price, specifications, model code, model year, invoicing currency, incoterm, and assigned supplier of the vehicles they carry.

Please complete this  [form](https://form.gov.sg/5e7db3d7b62f4d0011b83dc5)  and submit it with the supporting documents listed in Section D.

### Step 2: Approval by Singapore Customs

Once the application is approved, an approval letter from Singapore Customs containing details of the vehicle, such as unit price and incoterms, will be sent to the importer.

### Step 3: Payment of Duties and Goods & Services Tax (GST)

Once the approval letter is received, the importer should submit an In-Payment (Duty and GST) permit through TradeNet.

A declaring agent or freight forwarder can be appointed to submit the permit on the importer's behalf.

No refund of duty and GST except for cases of overpayment or erroneous payment will be allowed once the vehicle has been removed from  [customs control](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/importing-goods/importing-dutiable-motor-vehicles/guide-to-importing-dutiable-motor-vehicles#customscontrol) or a  [Free Trade Zone](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/importing-goods/importing-dutiable-motor-vehicles/guide-to-importing-dutiable-motor-vehicles#customscontrol).

### Step 4: Clearance of Motor Vehicle

Once the In-payment (Duty and GST) permit is approved, the importer may use the permit to remove the vehicle from the port or licensed warehouse.

### Check with Land Transport Authority (LTA)

Importers who wish to register their imported cars for usage on public roads should check with the LTA on their registration requirements and fees.

**Customs Control**

Goods are deemed to be under customs control when they are in any free trade zone, Government warehouse, licensed warehouse, bottling warehouse, post office or any place from which they may not be removed except with the permission of the proper officer of Singapore Customs.

**Free Trade Zone**

A Free Trade Zone (FTZ) is a demarcated area meant to facilitate entrepot trade and transhipment activities; where goods may be landed, handled, stored, re-exported or brought into Singapore. Duties and/or GST are not levied on goods brought into the FTZ until they are removed from the FTZ for use or sale in Singapore.
