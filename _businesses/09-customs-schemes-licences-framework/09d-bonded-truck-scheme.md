## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1)** **Do I need to pay GST for goods moved under the Bonded Truck Scheme?**

If the goods are transhipped from the land checkpoints to Changi Free Trade Zone and subsequently released into customs territory, you are required to take up an Inward GST Payment permit.

**2)** **What goods can be transported under the Bonded Truck Scheme?**

Only non-controlled and non-dutiable goods are allowed to be moved under the Bonded Truck Scheme.

**3)** **How do I check if the goods are controlled or dutiable?**

For dutiable goods, please refer to the  [List of Dutiable Goods](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods/list-of-dutiable-goods).

For controlled goods, you may check using this  [search engine](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do).
